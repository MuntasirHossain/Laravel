1. .env file can be encrypted.
  - Great for security as all passwords are in plaintext in this file. Encryption key length matters. While decrypting if force applied it will override the current .env file.

2. configuration can be changed at runtime. This is a great feature. You can achieve a lot from this, like  "Multi-Tenant Application with Dynamic Database Connection",
users database can be changed based on subdomains. Also, mail driver can be temporarily changed. A lot can be achieved.

3. configuration should be cached only in production as configuration changes frequently in development. If config is cached, .env will not be loaded during requests or
Artisan commands.

4. maintainance mode can be set up with a bypass token. This is so awesome. Using the secret token maintainace mode can be bypassed.

5. laravel cloud can be used for zero downtime deployment.
